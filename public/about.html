<h1>Hi I'm André.<br /> It's a pleasure to have you on my site</h1>

<p>Before I started with web developing I used to be a physicist and research engineer.
  I did research and development on lasers and laser modules. However, I also spent lots of time with coding.
  This together with a fondness for creating and designing finally brought me to web design.
  I'm always curious and I strive to get the best out of a task without losing sight of the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Currently I'm living in the Allgäu area in Bavaria/Germany where I enjoy its beautiful nature.</p>

<p>If you are interested in working with me do not hesitate to <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> me.</p>
